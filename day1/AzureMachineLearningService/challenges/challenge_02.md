# Use GitHub Actions with Azure Machine Learning
Get started with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to train a model on Azure Machine Learning. 

This article will teach you how to create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys a machine learning model to [Azure Machine Learning](./overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning.md). You'll train a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) linear regression model on the NYC Taxi dataset. 

GitHub Actions uses a workflow YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.


## Prerequisites

Before following the steps in this article, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you don't have one, use the steps in the [Quickstart: Create workspace resources](../articles/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources.md) article to create one.

* To install the Python SDK v2, use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-ml
    ```

    For more information, see [Install the Python SDK v2 for Azure Machine Learning](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-ml-readme).

* A GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up for [free](https://github.com/join).  

## Step 1. Get the code

Fork the following repo at GitHub:

```
https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples
```

## Step 2. Authenticate with Azure

You'll need to first define how to authenticate with Azure. You can use a [service principal](../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md#service-principal-object) or [OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect). 

### Generate deployment credentials

Create a service principal with the az ad sp create-for-rbac command in the Azure CLI. Run this command with Azure Cloud Shell in the Azure portal or by selecting the Try it button.

### Create secrets

[!INCLUDE [include](~/articles/reusable-content/github-actions/create-secrets-with-openid.md)]

## Step 3. Update `setup.sh` to connect to your Azure Machine Learning workspace

You'll need to update the CLI setup file variables to match your workspace. 

1. In your cloned repository, go to `azureml-examples/cli/`. 
1. Edit `setup.sh` and update these variables in the file. 
   
    |Variable  | Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |GROUP     |      Name of resource group    |
    |LOCATION     |    Location of your workspace (example: `eastus2`)    |
    |WORKSPACE     |     Name of Azure ML workspace     | 

## Step 4. Update `pipeline.yml` with your compute cluster name

You'll use a `pipeline.yml` file to deploy your Azure ML pipeline. This is a machine learning pipeline and not a DevOps pipeline. You only need to make this update if you're using a name other than `cpu-cluster` for your computer cluster name. 

1. In your cloned repository, go to `azureml-examples/cli/jobs/pipelines/nyc-taxi/pipeline.yml`. 
1. Each time you see `compute: azureml:cpu-cluster`, update the value of `cpu-cluster` with your compute cluster name. For example, if your cluster is named `my-cluster`, your new value would be `azureml:my-cluster`. There are five updates.

## Step 5: Run your GitHub Actions workflow

Your workflow authenticates with Azure, sets up the Azure Machine Learning CLI, and uses the CLI to train a model in Azure Machine Learning. 

# [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)


Your workflow file is made up of a trigger section and jobs:
- A trigger starts the workflow in the `on` section. The workflow runs by default on a cron schedule and when a pull request is made from matching branches and paths. Learn more about [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows). 
- In the jobs section of the workflow, you checkout code and log into Azure with your service principal secret.
- The jobs section also includes a setup action that installs and sets up the [Machine Learning CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md). Once the CLI is installed, the run job action runs your Azure Machine Learning `pipeline.yml` file to train a model with NYC taxi data.


### Enable your workflow

1. In your cloned repository, open `.github/workflows/cli-jobs-pipelines-nyc-taxi-pipeline.yml` and verify that your workflow looks like this. 

    ```yaml
    name: cli-jobs-pipelines-nyc-taxi-pipeline
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
      schedule:
        - cron: "0 0/4 * * *"
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main
          - sdk-preview
        paths:
          - cli/jobs/pipelines/nyc-taxi/**
          - .github/workflows/cli-jobs-pipelines-nyc-taxi-pipeline.yml
          - cli/run-pipeline-jobs.sh
          - cli/setup.sh
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: check out repo
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: azure login
          uses: azure/login@v1
          with:
            creds: ${{secrets.AZ_CREDS}}
        - name: setup
          run: bash setup.sh
          working-directory: cli
          continue-on-error: true
        - name: run job
          run: bash -x ../../../run-job.sh pipeline.yml
          working-directory: cli/jobs/pipelines/nyc-taxi
    ```

1. Select **View runs**. 
1. Enable workflows by selecting **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.
1. Select the **cli-jobs-pipelines-nyc-taxi-pipeline workflow** and choose to **Enable workflow**.

 # [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)

Your workflow file is made up of a trigger section and jobs:
- A trigger starts the workflow in the `on` section. The workflow runs by default on a cron schedule and when a pull request is made from matching branches and paths. Learn more about [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows). 
- In the jobs section of the workflow, you checkout code and log into Azure with the Azure login action using OpenID Connect.
- The jobs section also includes a setup action that installs and sets up the [Machine Learning CLI (v2)](how-to-configure-cli.md). Once the CLI is installed, the run job action runs your Azure Machine Learning `pipeline.yml` file to train a model with NYC taxi data.

### Enable your workflow

1. In your cloned repository, open `.github/workflows/cli-jobs-pipelines-nyc-taxi-pipeline.yml` and verify that your workflow looks like this.

## Step 6: Verify your workflow run

1. Open your completed workflow run and verify that the build job ran successfully. You'll see a green checkmark next to the job. 
1. Open Azure Machine Learning studio and navigate to the **nyc-taxi-pipeline-example**. Verify that each part of your job (prep, transform, train, predict, score) completed and that you see a green checkmark.

## Clean up resources

When your resource group and repository are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group and your GitHub repository.
